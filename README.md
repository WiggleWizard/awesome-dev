## UI
- [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - Very popular UI renderer.
- [Yoga](https://yogalayout.com/) - UI layout library from Facebook.
- [msdf-atlas-gen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen) - An SDF text generator to allow for modern day 2D text rendering.

# Benchmarking
- [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) - Super powerful benchmarking application that allows remote or embedded benchmarking of your application/game. Beware that it requires manual developer integration of benchmark zones.

## Misc
- [clip](https://github.com/dacap/clip) - Multi-MIME support clipboard "manager".

## Tools
- [Figma](figma.com) - UX/UI designing tool. Great if you are making a game or application that requires some complex UI.
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) - Minimal pixel art drawing and animating tool.

## Game/App Engines
- [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) - Great FOSS game engine and a fantastic study of alternative architectures for game engines.
- [SHADERed](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed) - A "minimal" shader editor/creator similar to shadertoy. Great for getting ideas on making demo scene type applications.

## Learning Resources
- [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject) - Has a full game engine from scratch Youtube series along with a whole host of other interesting videos.
- [Games From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/c/gamefromscratch) - Not really a resource to learn how to make games but rather a channel dedicated to presenting game development tool news.

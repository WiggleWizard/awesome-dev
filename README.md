# Benchmarking
- [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) - Super powerful benchmarking application that allows remote or embedded benchmarking of your application/game. Beware that it requires manual developer integration of benchmark zones.

## Misc

## Game/App Engines
- [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) - Fantastic study of alternative architectures for game engines.
- [SHADERed](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed) - A "minimal" shader editor/creator similar to shadertoy. Great for getting ideas on making demo scene type applications.

## Architecture
- [entt](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) - Popular flexible ECS library that's done right.
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) - Super fast header only logging library that supports custom formatting and log file rotation.

## UI
- [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) - Very popular UI renderer.
- [ImGuizmo](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo) - ImGui based transform gizmo. Good for making editors.
- [Yoga](https://yogalayout.com/) - UI layout library from Facebook.
- [msdf-atlas-gen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen) - An SDF text generator to allow for modern day 2D text rendering.
- [RmlUi](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi) - An HTML/CSS type C++ library that follows the MVC paradigm with data binding.

## Benchmarking
- [Tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) - Super powerful benchmarking application that allows remote or embedded benchmarking of your application/game. Beware that it requires manual developer integration of benchmark zones.

## Scripting
- [q3vm](https://github.com/jnz/q3vm) - Quake 3 virtual machine. Language is C-style.
- [sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) - A C++ library binding to Lua.

## Misc
- [clip](https://github.com/dacap/clip) - Multi-MIME support clipboard "manager".
- [cr](https://github.com/fungos/cr) - Simple header only hotreloading library.
- [portable-file-dialogs](https://github.com/samhocevar/portable-file-dialogs) - If you need an open/save file dialog then this is a great library for that.
- [cute_headers](https://github.com/RandyGaul/cute_headers) - Collection of header files specifically for games development.

## Tools
- [Figma](figma.com) - UX/UI designing tool. Great if you are making a game or application that requires some complex UI.
- [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) - Minimal pixel art drawing and animating tool.

## Base Engines
- [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) - A modular minimal engine that contains almost everything you need to program a higher level engine.
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) - Another minimal "engine" to get you started on a higher level engine yourself.

## Game/App Engines
- [Godot](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) - Great FOSS game engine and a fantastic study of alternative architectures for game engines.
- [SHADERed](https://github.com/dfranx/SHADERed) - A "minimal" shader editor/creator similar to shadertoy. Great for getting ideas on making demo scene type applications.
- [OpenTomb](https://github.com/opentomb/OpenTomb) - A Tomb Raider engine.
- [xray](https://github.com/OpenXRay/xray-16) - An open sourced S.T.A.L.K.E.R engine.
- [Lumix](https://github.com/nem0/LumixEngine)

## Learning Resources
- [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheChernoProject) - Has a full game engine from scratch Youtube series along with a whole host of other interesting videos.
- [Games From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/c/gamefromscratch) - Not really a resource to learn how to make games but rather a channel dedicated to presenting game development tool news.
